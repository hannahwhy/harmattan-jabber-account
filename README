Generic Jabber support for MeeGo Harmattan, aka "that thing that runs on the
Nokia N9 and N950".

At present, this code just adds a couple of screens to the Accounts application,
and doesn't actually connect just yet.  I'm still working on it.

There exists an issue in Harmattan's theme server that necessitates a reboot to
get the Jabber icon to display correctly:

	(from #harmattan @ irc.freenode.net)
	<djszapi> The problem seems to be that icon defined in
	.provider file is loaded through themeserver. Themeserver reads new
	icons only when it is started(bootup). .Desktop file icons have same
	problem but in .desktop files it is possible to define icons with full
	path. If full path is used then icon is loaded directly from filesystem
	not via themeserver. This full path trick unfortunately doesn't work
	with accounts.
