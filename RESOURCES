Introduction
============

Harmattan's accounts framework has the unfortunate property of being sparsely
documented.  Worse, the documentation divide is pretty much at the open/closed
source line: the Accounts-Qt documentation (which is open source) is present,
but all implementations shipped with Harmattan (which are proprietary) are
totally undocumented.

To make matters worse, Accounts-Qt doesn't have any concrete examples of account
plugins.

I'll collect documentation and examples of account integration code in this
file.  As time goes on I hope to be able to assemble a complete enough picture
to implement an XMPP account plugin with minimal code.

talk.maemo.org app
==================

http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=79984
https://gitorious.org/forum-qml/forum-tmo/trees/master

This is an application to read and post to talk.maemo.org.  It includes an
example of an account provider.

Accounts & SSO
==============

http://gitorious.org/accounts-sso
http://harmattan-dev.nokia.com/docs/library/html/accounts-qt/main.html

Nokia's official documentation for Accounts-Qt, as well as source code related
to Meego's account and single-sign-on infrastructure.

web2sms
=======

https://gitorious.org/web2sms/web2sms/trees/master

An interface to web2sms for Harmattan.  Contains an account setup screen,
account provider, and other bits.  Probably more than an XMPP plugin needs,
but still the most complete open-source consumer of Harmattan's accounts API 
that I've found.
